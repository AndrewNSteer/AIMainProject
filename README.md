Ai project schedule

define the performance metric for the dynamic difficulty
could include 
-Time to complete objectives (e.g., reaching certain areas).
-Health/Resources (remaining health or items collected).
-Actions per Minute (APM) or similar indicators of interaction frequency.
-Mistake frequency (e.g., failed jumps or damage taken).

Track and log performance data
Use Unityâ€™s scripting features to log player actions and performance. For example, you might use PlayerPrefs or custom data classes to store information on player performance over time.

analyse player performance
Establish thresholds or ranges for each metric that signal certain performance levels (e.g., "beginner," "intermediate," "advanced"). This lets you create categories that can inform procedural adjustments.

link the performance to the procedural generation parameters
Determine how performance metrics should impact specific aspects of the landscape:

Terrain Complexity: Make environments smoother or more challenging by adjusting slope, adding/removing obstacles, or varying platform distances based on performance.
Resource Availability: Increase resources (health packs, items) in certain areas if the player struggles, or reduce them to increase challenge.
Terrain Variety: For skilled players, introduce more complex, varied terrain patterns; for newer players, stick to flatter or more straightforward terrain.

implement real time adjustments
Create methods in your terrain generation script that take in performance data and modify parameters. For example:

Using Perlin Noise Parameters: Adjust the frequency or amplitude of Perlin noise to create more/less rugged landscapes.
Level of Detail (LOD): Increase or decrease detail levels in terrain features.


public class TerrainAdjuster : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float difficultyMultiplier = 1.0f;
    public TerrainGenerator terrainGenerator;

    void AdjustTerrain(float playerPerformance)
    {
        // Adjust noise parameters based on player performance
        float noiseAmplitude = Mathf.Lerp(1.0f, 2.0f, playerPerformance);
        float noiseFrequency = Mathf.Lerp(0.5f, 1.0f, playerPerformance);

        // Apply adjustments in terrain generator
        terrainGenerator.SetNoiseParameters(noiseAmplitude, noiseFrequency);
    }
}
